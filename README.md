# FritzBox -> SPDyn - Updater

This script scrapes the IPv4 and IPv6 external address of an AVM Fritz!Box and uses them to update a dynamic DNS entry at SPDyn (spdyn.de). 
It can be used to keep the dynamic DNS entry up to date from a local server behind a Fritz!Box internet router.

You can also use it to implement your own script for other dynamic DNS servers. 
The script is completely seperated into an IP scraping and updating part so you can simply replace what you need.
